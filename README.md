# JARGONATOR
  _Say something... without really saying anything._
  

## What is it?
Jargonator generates fake catch phrases using [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker) that can inspire you explain simple concepts in an unnecessarily complicated way. This is a small side-project I made to practice using Node.js and Express. 

## Technologies Used
**Back-End**
* Node.js
  * [Express](https://www.npmjs.com/package/express): Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework
  * [Morgan](https://www.npmjs.com/package/morgan): HTTP request logger middleware
  * [Faker](https://www.npmjs.com/package/faker): Generate massive amounts of fake data

**Front-End**
* JavaScript
  * jQuery
* HTML5
* CSS3

## Feedback
I would love to hear from you, particularly if you manage to use any generated phrases in real life :smile:
